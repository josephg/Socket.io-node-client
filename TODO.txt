- "lib/utils.js" is a *copy* of
  <https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/blob/master/lib/socket.io/utils.js>,
  even though this package already depends on the "socket.io" package.
  That sucks.  I don't know of a way to get to socket.io's "utils.js" module
  with a `require` statement. Anyone?
